# Ex.No: 6 To check whether the string is Palindrome and generate test cases.

### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### AIM: 
Write a Python program to check whether the string is Palindrome and generate test cases. 
### Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Get an input from the user by prompting 
3. Run a loop form 0 to len/2.
4. Check if the characters are the same both from the start and the end till len/2. 
5. If it is, return the result that it is a palindrome.
6. Else, return that it is not a palindrome. 
7. Stop the program.
### Program:

### Result:
Thus, a program to check palindrome has been written and test cases have been written and verified successfully.
